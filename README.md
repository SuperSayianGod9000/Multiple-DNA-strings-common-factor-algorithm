# Multiple-DNA-strings-common-factor-algorithm
Suppose I have  ATTTGGC TGCCTTA CGGTATC GAAAATT these DNA strings. I need to find a common repeating element of a fixed size(say k) with a margin of error of hamming distance(d).  By a margin of error I mean if the hamming distance is 1 in elements of size 3 AAA=AAT=AAC=AAG=ATA=ACA=AGA=CAA=TAA=GAA
